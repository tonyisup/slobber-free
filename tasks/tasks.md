## Requirements

*   **Database:** Choose a database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or SQLite for initial development). Define the data models needed for the application.
*   **Stripe:**  Set up a Stripe account and obtain the API keys. Implement the payment processing logic in the `/api/payment` route. Handle successful and failed payments.
*   **OpenAI:** Set up an OpenAI account and obtain the API key. Implement the image processing logic in the `/api/estimate-cost` route. Implement the cost estimation logic based on OpenAI's pricing model.
*   **Transparency Page:** Implement the logic to fetch real-time cost and contribution data from the database and display it on the transparency page. Use a charting library (e.g., Chart.js) to visualize the data.
*   **Front-End:**  Create React components for image upload, display, payment form, and download functionality.  Connect these components to the API routes using `fetch` or `axios`.
*   **Deployment:** Create a Vercel account and deploy the application.
*   **Testing:** Write unit tests and perform end-to-end testing to ensure all features are working correctly.

## Future Tasks
