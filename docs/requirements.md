# Product Requirements Document: SlobberFree Paws

**1. Introduction**

*   **1.1 Purpose:** This document outlines the requirements for SlobberFree Paws, a web application that uses AI to remove saliva ("slobber") from dog photos.
*   **1.2 Goals:**
    *   Provide a user-friendly service that quickly and effectively removes saliva from dog photos.
    *   Offer a "pay what you want" pricing model with full transparency.
    *   Build a sustainable and ethical business that supports ongoing development.
*   **1.3 Target Audience:** Dog owners who want to share high-quality photos of their dogs online but are often hindered by visible saliva.

**2. Goals**
*   Provide a user-friendly service that quickly and effectively removes saliva from dog photos.
*   Offer a "pay what you want" pricing model with full transparency.
*   Build a sustainable and ethical business that supports ongoing development.

**3. Features**

*   **3.1 Core Feature: Slobber Removal**
    *   Users can upload a dog photo (JPG, PNG).
    *   The AI automatically detects and removes saliva from the photo.
    *   Users can view the original and processed photos side-by-side.
    *   The processed photo is downloadable.
*   **3.2 Pricing and Payment**
    *   After processing, the system displays an estimated cost based on image size and processing complexity (using OpenAI API).
    *   Users can enter their desired payment amount (including $0.00).
    *   Payments are processed securely through Stripe.
    *   Download is enabled after successful payment (even for $0.00 payments).
*   **3.3 Transparency Page**
    *   A dedicated page shows real-time running costs (server, AI processing, hosting).
    *   The page displays total contributions received.
    *   The page calculates and displays the net balance (contributions - costs).
    *   Visualizations (charts) are used to represent cost and contribution trends.
*   **3.4 User Authentication (Optional - Future Enhancement)**
    *   Users can create accounts to track their usage and payment history (potentially for subscription tiers later).

**4. Functional Requirements**

*   **4.1 Image Upload:**
    *   Accept JPG and PNG file formats.
    *   Limit file size to 10MB.
    *   Display clear error messages for invalid file formats or sizes.
*   **4.2 AI Processing:**
    *   Utilize OpenAI's API for image analysis and retouching.
    *   Estimate the cost of processing based on OpenAI's pricing model and the image characteristics.
    *   Handle potential API errors gracefully.
*   **4.3 Payment Processing:**
    *   Integrate with Stripe to securely process payments.
    *   Handle successful and failed payments appropriately.
    *   Store transaction data in a database.
*   **4.4 Transparency Page Updates:**
    *   Automatically update the transparency page with real-time cost and contribution data.
    *   Schedule a background task to periodically fetch and update this data.

**5. Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **5.1 Performance:**
    *   Image processing should be completed within a reasonable time frame (e.g., under 15 seconds).
    *   The website should be responsive and load quickly.
*   **5.2 Scalability:**
    *   The system should be able to handle a growing number of users and image processing requests.
*   **5.3 Security:**
    *   Protect sensitive data (API keys, payment information) using secure storage and encryption.
    *   Implement appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access.
*   **5.4 Usability:**
    *   The website should be easy to use and navigate, even for users with limited technical skills.
*   **5.5 Accessibility:**
    *   The website should be accessible to users with disabilities, following WCAG guidelines.

**6. Release Criteria**

*   All core features (slobber removal, pricing, transparency page) must be fully implemented and tested.
*   The website must meet the performance, scalability, security, and usability requirements.
*   The code must be well-documented and maintainable.

**7. Future Considerations**

*   **Subscription Plans:** Offer subscription plans for unlimited use.
*   **Advanced Editing Tools:** Provide additional photo editing tools (e.g., background removal, object removal).
*   **Mobile App:** Develop a mobile app for easier access.

**8. Open Issues**

*   Specific OpenAI pricing details need to be confirmed.
*   The exact cost estimation formula needs to be refined.
*   The visualization library for the transparency page needs to be chosen.
