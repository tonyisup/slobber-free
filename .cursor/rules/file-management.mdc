## Required Actions After Code Changes
1. READ docs/architecture.mermaid to verify architectural compliance
2. UPDATE docs/status.md with:
   - Current progress
   - Any new issues encountered
   - Completed items
3. VALIDATE changes against docs/technical.md specifications
4. VERIFY task progress against tasks/tasks.md
